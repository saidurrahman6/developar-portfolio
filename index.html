            <p>I am a student because I want to learn new things. For me education is very important. That is why I want to
                name my three principal reasons. First, I am a student because I want a better future with an interesting
                career. Second, I want to prove to myself that I have the capacity to do something good and different with
                my life. Finally, I am a student because I want to help other people.</p>
